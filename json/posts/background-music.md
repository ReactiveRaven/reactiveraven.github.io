Maybe not every aspect of your coding environment is under your control, but a great way to block out the world and protect [your flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology%29) is music. Plus, music comes with headphones, the universal do-not-disturb symbol.

People respond to music in different ways, and there are studies showing [vocals in music are just as bad](http://www.mindthesciencegap.org/2012/10/08/does-music-help-you-study/) as the background noise you're blocking out. So we have to be careful! Personally I'm a fan of orchestral mashups, movie soundtracks, and so on. They help set up a mood and don't have any words to distract you.

A great service is [8tracks.com](http://8tracks.com/). It lets you search for the kind of music you like with obvious tags rather than esoteric genres (Goa Psy anyone?)- so you can look for 'coding + instrumental' and _there are [playlists that match](http://8tracks.com/explore/coding+instrumental/popular)_.

Here are a few playlists I'm enjoying at the moment:

 * [Classical Crossover](http://8tracks.com/musicalescape/classical-crossover)
 * [That Study Juice](http://8tracks.com/heylook_itsbrooke/that-study-juice)
 * Anything by [Polytronaut](http://8tracks.com/polytronaut)
