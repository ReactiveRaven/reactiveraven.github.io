Distilled from the great resource from Simon over at [NewTriks](http://newtriks.com/2013/06/11/automating-angularjs-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/)

Lets get started by making sure we have everything we need installed. Fire up a terminal and install the following with NPM:

```bash
sudo npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower karma generator-angular
```

This'll get us:

* yeoman
* grunt (you do need the cli bit, its separated out into multiple packages and will pull all the relevant bits in)
* bower
* karma

..and install the generators so Yeoman knows how to generate Angular projects.
